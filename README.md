To examine how activation of different toll-like receptors (TLR) impacts gene expression in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), 
we cultured peripheral blood monocytes from children with ASD, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified 
(PDDNOS) and typically developing children and treated them with either lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
to activate TLR2 or 4 respectively. Following 24 hours of stimulation, we then performed RNA sequencing to profile mRNA 
responses between non-treated (NT), LTA and LPS treated samples for each diagnosis (TD, ASD or PDDNOS).
